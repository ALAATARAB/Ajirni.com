## Problem

### Many times, we need a certain item for a specific task, but we don't have that item and we only need it this one time! On the other hand, we often buy things that we rarely use

## Solution

### And that's where the idea came from, We can now link between the owner of the item and the one in need of it. On one hand, the owners can now earn income by renting out their items, and on the other hand, the renter can rent the item without wasting money on purchasing a new one

## Used Technologies
